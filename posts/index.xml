      <description>How I gained persistent access to Burp’s Collaborator Sessions In this write up, I set out an easy way to gain persistent access to Burp Suite’s Collaborator sessions.

Particularly when you consider that if successfully exploited it results in a remote code execution with Window’s highest possible level of privilege: NT_AUTHORITY/SYSTEM - which surpasses even ‘Administrator’.</description>
